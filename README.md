# lifelog

“*If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it*”. The idea is to provide an easy and intuitive way to log our day to day activities. The continuous urge for humans to improve their lives is evident. With this data, one can analyze to figure out answer to questions like 'where most of our time is used' and 'where you can save time to invest on something more important'.

This is a straightforward log application; however the success of it depends on how easy and intuitive it is. In fact, my idea is to have the user NOT to do a lot of data entry, instead the application should intelligently log the user's activities or at least help the user to log with less efforts. 

*Some of my idea are*: 
- Integrating with Google’s voice recognition with which the user could speak into the phone and the app would log the activity on behalf of him. 
- Have the app recommend the right activity based on users past activity history, be it based on the current time and location of the user. 

Environment: 
- Go: mainstream programming language
- Google Appengine: to host the application
- Github: source control


Code for the life log web application lives here. 

*I'm looking for contributors for this project, especially for the UI/UX. Please let me know if you are interested.*
