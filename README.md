# lifelog

“*If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it*”. The idea is to provide an easy and intuitive way to log our day to day activities. The continuous urge for humans to improve their lives is evident. With this data, one can analyze to figure out answer to questions like 'where most of our time is used' and 'where you can save time to invest on something more important'.
